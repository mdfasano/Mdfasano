Software engineer with a diverse background in bartending, coaching, 
and fitness instruction. Eager to transition the teamwork, communication, and time-management skills that I  developed while bartending and coaching into the office. I am a quick learner with a practiced ability to efficiently digest and internalize new information. I am seeking opportunities to contribute my strong work ethic, adaptability, and commitment to continuous growth to succeed in the dynamic field of software engineering.
